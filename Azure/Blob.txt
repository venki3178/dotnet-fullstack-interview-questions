Azure Blob Storage is object storage that is used to store massive amounts of unstructured data such as text or binary data.

Key components:

Storage Account: The top-level namespace for accessing blobs.
Container: A logical grouping of blobs, similar to a folder.
Blob: The actual file stored in a container.
Access Tiers: Hot, Cool, and Archive for cost optimization.

What are the different types of blobs in Azure Blob Storage?

Azure Blob Storage has three types of blobs:

Block Blobs – Used for storing text and binary data, optimized for uploads and downloads.
Append Blobs – Used for log files and scenarios where data needs to be appended.
Page Blobs – Used for random read/write operations, typically in Azure VMs for disk storage

How do you secure Azure Blob Storage?
Answer:
Azure Blob Storage security can be ensured through:

Shared Access Signatures (SAS) – Grants limited-time, controlled access.
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) – Assigns permissions based on Azure AD roles.
Storage Account Keys – Used for full access, but should be rotated periodically.
Private Endpoints – Restricts access to blobs within a Virtual Network (VNet).
Customer-Managed Keys (CMK) – Allows encryption with customer-owned keys.

What is the maximum size of a blob in Azure Blob Storage?
Answer:
Block Blob: Up to 5 TB (individual block: 4 MiB–100 MiB, max 50,000 blocks).
Append Blob: Up to 5 TB (max 50,000 blocks, 4 MiB per block).
Page Blob: Up to 8 TiB, used in Azure VMs.

How can you migrate on-premises data to Azure Blob Storage?
Answer:
AzCopy (for fast uploads).
Azure Migrate (for structured migration).
Azure Data Factory (for ETL processes).
Azure Import/Export (physical disk shipment).
Azure Data Box (for petabyte-scale transfers).

Versioning vs. Other Data Protection Features
Feature	Purpose
Versioning		Keeps old versions of blobs on updates or deletions
Soft Delete		Keeps deleted blobs for a retention period
Snapshots		Manually created point-in-time copies of blobs
Immutable Storage	Prevents modifications or deletions for compliance
