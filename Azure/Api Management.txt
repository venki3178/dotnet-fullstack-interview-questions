What is Api Management?

API Management is reliable, secure, scalable way to publish all our API's in a centralized location. It will provide single interface
and essential tools to provision and manage all our API's.

Use Case: API Management is not used to deploy applications or services but to expose and manage APIs in a controlled and scalable way. It is commonly used for businesses that have multiple APIs, need to provide a unified entry point to those APIs, or need to expose APIs to third-party developers.

What are differences between API Management, App Service and Virtual Machine?

API Management:
	Focuses on managing APIs (not hosting them).
	Provides features for securing, analyzing, and monitoring API traffic.
	Does not directly host your web applications or services.
App Service:
	Used for deploying and hosting web applications and APIs (PaaS solution).
	Takes care of scaling, patching, and other infrastructure management tasks for you.
	Suitable for modern web apps and APIs that need to be quickly deployed and scaled.
Virtual Machines:
	Provides full control over infrastructure (IaaS).
	Requires you to manage the operating system, security, and scaling manually.
	Suitable for legacy applications or complex scenarios requiring specific configurations.

In Summary:
	API Management is for managing and controlling APIs (providing a gateway for access and securing/exposing them).
	App Service is for deploying and hosting web apps or APIs in a managed, scalable environment.
	Virtual Machines provide full control over infrastructure to run any application, including APIs, but require more management.
