When Class will loads?

Answer:
When any static member (field, method, property) of the class is accessed for the first time: or
When any non static member accessed first time.

What will happens when class loads?

1.CLR loads class metadata (type info)	Into Loader Heap
class metadata like 
Metadata Component	
Class Name
Namespace	
Static Field Info	
Instance Field Info	
Static Constructor (.cctor)	
Static Method signatures
instant method signatures
Access Modifiers	

2.CLR: Allocates memory for all static fields in Loader heap/High-Frequency Heap even we accessed one static field, regardless of whether they’re explicitly initialized inside the static constructor or not.

3.CLR: Executes the static constructor (only once per type), before the first access completes.

4.CLR creates object/instance and allocate memory for object in managed heap.

5.CLR allocates memory for object/instance fields.



class A {

static int a =10;
}

Class B{
static int a = 20;
}

Console.WriteLine(B.a);
Console.WriteLine(A.a);
what it will print? If static variable is shared across resources does variable value will be replaced or override?


✅ Output:

20
10

✅ Why?
Important Concepts:
	Static variables are shared per class, not across classes.
	Each class has its own separate static memory space.
	A.a belongs to class A, and B.a belongs to class B. They do not interfere with each other.
