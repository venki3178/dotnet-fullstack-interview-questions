What is the size of float, double, and decimal in C#?

float: 4 bytes (32-bit)
double: 8 bytes (64-bit)
decimal: 16 bytes (128-bit)

What is the precision difference between them?
float: ~7 significant digits
double: ~15–16 significant digits
decimal: ~28–29 significant digits

Which one uses base-10 representation?
Only decimal uses base-10.
float and double use binary (base-2) representation.

What is the default floating-point type in C#?
double

What suffixes are used when declaring literals?
float: f or F
double: d or D (optional)
decimal: m or M

Why does 0.1 + 0.2 not equal 0.3 when using float or double?
Because they use binary floating-point, where many decimal fractions (like 0.1) cannot be represented exactly.

Which is faster: float, double, or decimal?
float is fastest.

If memory is critical and acceptable precision loss is allowed, which would you choose?
float

Can you compare two floating-point numbers directly? Why or why not?
No. Due to rounding errors, comparisons should use an epsilon (tolerance) for approximate equality.

Explain float.NaN and double.NaN.
Special constant representing "Not a Number", typically the result of undefined operations.
