Concurrent Programming:
Concurrency means breaking down a task into independent sub-tasks and switching between them, which gives the illusion 
that they are running at the same time.

Example:
In a single-core processor, tasks are executed concurrently by switching between them so fast that it appears they are running simultaneously (time-sliced).
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Parallel Programming:

Parallel Programming means executing multiple threads simultaneously on multiple CPU cores to maximize CPU utilization.
It is mainly used for CPU-bound operations.

For example, when a program has a large computational task, it can be divided into smaller subtasks.
Each subtask is then scheduled to run on a separate thread from the ThreadPool, and these threads can execute on different CPU cores in parallel.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is Async and Await?

Async is keywords which is used to make a method as asynchronous method and performs an asynchronous operation.
Await is keyword What is the await keyword used for?

Pauses method execution until the awaited Task completes, then resumes on a continuation; it does not block the calling thread.

Can we use async without await?
Yes—compiler allows it but the method runs synchronously until it returns a Task; async without await generates a warning and can be misleading.

Task: 
A Task represents an operation that runs asynchronously without blocking the main thread.

What is Task<T>?
A Task that produces a result of type T when the asynchronous operation completes.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is TPL(Task Parallel Library)?

TPL is a set of APIs provided by Dot Net Framework and it simplifies the process of adding parallelism and concurrency to applications.
TPL abstracts the underlying complexities of thread management, making it easier to write efficient, scalable, and responsive applications.
It allows developers to write parallel code by breaking tasks into smaller sub-tasks, 
TPL uses multiple cores of processor for running multiple tasks parallel.
TPL is based on the concept of Task, which represents an asynchronous operation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is Process?
process is an independent program that executed by the operating system

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is the Thread?
A Thread is the smallest unit of execution of Process.

1. What is asynchronous programming?

Executing operations without blocking the calling thread

What problem does async/await solve in C#?

It makes writing non-blocking code easy and readable

3. What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous execution?

Synchronous blocks the caller until completion; asynchronous returns control immediately to main thread without non blocking main thread


🧩 1️⃣ Purpose of Task.WhenAll

Combines multiple tasks into a single composite task.
Returns a Task that completes when all child tasks finish.
It does not create threads or execute code itself — just coordinates completion.
Simplifies waiting for multiple async operations at once.

⚙️ 2️⃣ Execution Responsibility

The individual tasks handle their own execution.
Task.WhenAll only observes and aggregates their results or exceptions.
It’s a task orchestrator, not a worker.

💻 3️⃣ Task Types and Behavior
🔹 CPU-bound Tasks
Created with Task.Run or heavy computations.
Run on ThreadPool threads.
Can utilize multiple cores → true parallelism.

Example: Task.Run(() => Compute()).

🔹 I/O-bound Tasks
Created via async APIs (HttpClient, file I/O, database calls).
Use async I/O completion ports — no thread is blocked while waiting.
Run concurrently in time, not in parallel on cores.

Example: await HttpClient.GetAsync(url).

🧠 4️⃣ ThreadPool and Core Utilization

ThreadPool manages a pool of worker threads.
Threads are distributed across available CPU cores.
Uses work-stealing queues for load balancing.
Dynamically scales using the hill-climbing algorithm.
Ensures optimal CPU utilization without thread explosion.

⚙️ 5️⃣ Parallelism vs Concurrency
Type	Definition	Example
Parallelism	Multiple tasks execute at the same time on different cores	Task.Run (CPU-bound)
Concurrency	Multiple tasks overlap in time, not necessarily on different cores	async I/O (GetAsync)

Task.WhenAll supports both — depending on what tasks you pass in.

🔁 6️⃣ Task Continuations and Scheduling
After a task completes, continuations (e.g. next await) are scheduled.
These run via the TaskScheduler — usually the ThreadPool.
In UI apps (like WPF/WinForms), a SynchronizationContext may restore execution to the UI thread.
In ASP.NET Core, the SynchronizationContext is null, so continuations return to the ThreadPool.

⚙️ 7️⃣ Internals of Task.WhenAll

Creates a composite task that monitors all input tasks.
Internally uses a counter to track remaining tasks.
When all child tasks signal completion, the parent task completes.

Exceptions are aggregated into a single AggregateException if any tasks fail.

🔩 8️⃣ Core Usage Summary
Task Type	Threads Used	Cores Used	Execution Model
CPU-bound	✅ ThreadPool threads	✅ Yes (parallel)	True parallelism
I/O-bound	❌ (non-blocking)	❌ No	Asynchronous concurrency
Mixed	Both	Partially	Parallel + Concurrent mix
🧾 9️⃣ Practical Summary

Task.WhenAll is asynchronous, not multithreaded by itself.
Multi-core usage depends entirely on how tasks are defined.
CPU work → multiple cores; I/O → same thread, async overlapped.

It’s ideal for running independent tasks simultaneously.

✅ 10️⃣ Quick Recap

Task.WhenAll aggregates multiple tasks.
It doesn’t run threads — it just waits asynchronously.
CPU-bound work → ThreadPool → multiple cores → parallel.
I/O-bound work → async I/O → concurrency without threads.
Uses TPL and ThreadPool for efficient scheduling.
Continuations handled by TaskScheduler or SynchronizationContext.
Scales automatically with system cores.
Exceptions combined via AggregateException.
Non-blocking and highly efficient.
Designed for maximum concurrency with minimal resource overhead.
