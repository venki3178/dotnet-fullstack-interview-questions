What is the difference between StringBuilder and String in .NET?

String: Immutable, meaning once created, the value cannot be changed. Any operation that modifies the string creates a new object.
StringBuilder: Mutable, allowing for the modification of the string without creating new instances, making it more efficient for concatenation or manipulation.
