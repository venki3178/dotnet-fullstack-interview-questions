What is Memory Cache?

In .NET, MemoryCache is used for in-memory caching to store frequently accessed data, reducing the need for expensive database queries or computations.

the Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Memory namespace in .NET Core and .NET 5+.

Steps: Create MemoryCache object 
	MemoryCache cache = new MemoryCache(new MemoryCacheOptions())

in options we specify expiry time and reset time

In memory vs Cache memory

In Memory
Data stored in RAM during application execution.
Data is lost when the application restarts.
List<User> users = new List<User>();


Cache Memory
Temporary storage to hold frequently accessed data.
Also volatile, but can be refreshed or loaded from external storage (DB, files, etc.).
memoryCache.Set("users", users, TimeSpan.FromMinutes(10));


--------------------------------------------------------
Generics:


Generics in C# allow us to define classes, interfaces, and methods with a placeholder for data types. This increases code reusability, type safety, and performance by allowing a single implementation to work with multiple data types.

Task.Wait() vs await

1. Task.Wait()
Blocks the calling thread until the task completes.
Can cause deadlocks in UI applications.
Does not use the async/await pattern effectively.

static void Main()
    {
        Task task = DoSomethingAsync();
        task.Wait(); // Blocks the main thread until the task completes
        Console.WriteLine("Task Completed");
    }


await Keyword
Asynchronously waits for the task to complete without blocking the thread.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Struct vs Class

Struct:
It is Value type
Stored in Stack
Cannot be null unless we make it nullable manually
Do not support inheritance
Require boxing and unboxing

Class
Reference type
stored in heap
Can be nullable
Supports inheritance
No need of boxing and unboxing issues

what is the use of constructor in abstract class
✅ Abstract class constructors are called before derived class constructors.
✅ Used to initialize fields and enforce rules before object creation.
✅ Derived classes must call the base constructor (if required).

The main purpose of a constructor in an abstract class is to initialize fields, set up default values, or enforce logic before any derived class is created.
